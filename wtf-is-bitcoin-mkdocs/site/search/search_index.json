Long ago, money didn\u2019t exist, and it was basically the law of the jungle:  </p> <p>You have a goat, I'm hungry, I\u2019m stronger than you, I kill you and take your goat. </p> <p>Harsh, but true.</p> <p>Over time, people started forming tribes and communities, and they needed a way to exchange value. That\u2019s how barter was born: trading one good for another.</p> <p>But barter had big limitations:  </p> <p>What if I need three eggs but only have one cow? Maybe a cow is worth 300 eggs\u2026 do I cut it into pieces? Then I\u2019d basically lose the whole cow.</p> <p>Barter quickly became a logistical nightmare because of divisibility, fungibility, and the challenge of converting one good into another, without a proper monetary system. On top of that, many goods weren\u2019t durable: they spoiled fast, being organic or perishable, and were often hard to transport for long distances.  </p> <p>Pay close attention to the bold words above: they\u2019re clues pointing to important properties of money.  </p> <p>Noticing the limitations of barter, people began designating specific goods (with certain objective properties) as money. For example, durable, easily transportable, and divisible goods like salt and honey started being used. Some cultures even used shells or stones as money.  </p> <p>The next step was metals: they were strong, durable, and scarce. Over time, a kind of global distributed \u2018game theory\u2019 naturally led to gold becoming the preferred form of money. Its unique properties made it the \u2018king\u2019 of money for over 5,000 years, in almost every region of the world.  </p> <p>At this point, it should be clear that money\u2019s properties can\u2019t be entirely subjective, as some modern economic theories suggest.  There are objective properties that really matter and some of these key properties include:  </p> <ul> <li>Scarcity: how limited and available a good is.  </li> <li>Fungibility: how interchangeable each unit is with any other.</li> <li>Durability: how well it lasts and keeps value over time.</li> <li>Portability: how easily it can move through space and time.</li> <li>Recognizability: how easy it is to verify (and how hard to counterfeit).</li> <li>Divisibility: how easily it can be split into smaller units.</li> </ul> <p>By the time you finish reading this site, it should be clear that Bitcoin surpasses gold (the king of money) in almost every one of these properties, with perhaps the only exception being fungibility.  </p>"},{"location":"what-bitcoin-is-not/","title":"What Bitcoin is not","text":""},{"location":"what-bitcoin-is-not/#all-the-stories-youve-heard","title":"All the stories you\u2019ve heard","text":"<p>Let\u2019s start with the assumption that everything you\u2019ve heard from friends, family, the media, or anywhere else about Bitcoin so far is either wrong or incomplete, and let\u2019s go back to the fundamentals.</p> <p>First, let\u2019s clarify what Bitcoin definitely is not:  </p> <ul> <li>It\u2019s not a get-rich-quick scheme. Sure, people have made \"money\", but Bitcoin wasn\u2019t designed as a lottery ticket.  </li> <li>It\u2019s not a physical coin you can hold. There\u2019s no gold inside, and no banknotes: Bitcoin lives digitally. </li> <li>It\u2019s not a scam or Ponzi scheme. The tech is open, transparent, and mathematically sound. Scammers may lurk around it, but Bitcoin itself is as legit as it gets.   </li> <li>It\u2019s not controlled by any government or company. No central bank pulling strings here.  </li> <li>It\u2019s not only for criminals. Sure, some illegal transactions happen (same for traditional money), but most Bitcoin use is completely legal: think businesses, investors, even governments.  </li> <li>It\u2019s not anonymous in the way you might think. Transactions are public; your name isn\u2019t there, but your activity is (It\u2019s still possible to have strong privacy with Bitcoin). </li> <li>It\u2019s not magic money. Bitcoin still follows rules, math, and code, no fairy dust involved.  </li> <li>It\u2019s not going away if governments issue digital currencies: Bitcoin is decentralized and no one can switch it off.  </li> <li>It\u2019s not all bad for the environment, as a matter of fact is the exact opposite.  </li> </ul> <p>We will dive deep into some of these points along the way.</p> <p> Now that we\u2019ve cleared up what Bitcoin isn\u2019t, let\u2019s take a look at what it actually is!</p>"},{"location":"what-bitcoin-is/","title":"What Bitcoin is","text":""},{"location":"what-bitcoin-is/#many-things-at-once","title":"Many things at once","text":"<p>Bitcoin is a lot of things: a distributed system, a revolutionary technology, an open-source software, a peer-to-peer network, a massive computing power\u2026  but at the end of the day, Bitcoin is money.  </p>"},{"location":"what-bitcoin-is/#what-is-money","title":"What is money?","text":"<p>Intuitively, we all think we know the answer to this question, but if we pause and think for a moment we quickly realize that words fall short, hand-waving begins and circular definitions start to pile up. And yet, most of our lives are spent working to earn money.  </p> <p>There isn\u2019t a single definition of what money is, but one that works really well is this:  </p> <p>A technology to move value across space and time.  </p> <p>This already tells us a lot. First of all, we\u2019re talking about a technology and, as we know, technologies can take many forms: some are more efficient at their purpose, others less so.  </p> <p>Value is trickier to define, but we can say that it\u2019s the importance or usefulness of something, shown by what people are willing to give, sacrifice, or trade for it.  </p> <p>Finally, we have space and time.  </p> <p>We can understand the definition of money better with an example:</p> <p>Imagine you\u2019re good at something and offer that service to others. Since it has value for them, there will be demand, and they\u2019ll recognize your contribution through something that lets you preserve the value you created (after all, your time is your most important resource). So you need a way to \u2018crystallize\u2019 the time and value you\u2019ve put into the service. That\u2019s money. Money then lets you transfer this value across space: for example, sending it to someone far away  and time:  for example, saving it or passing it down to your grandchildren. Since the time and skills you put into providing a valuable, in-demand service come from you, only you should own the money you earn, and it should be entirely your choice when and how to spend it.  </p> <p></p> <p>Keep reading for a brief history of money!</p>"}]}
