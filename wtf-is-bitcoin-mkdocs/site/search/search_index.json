Long ago, money didn\u2019t exist, and it was basically the law of the jungle:  </p> <p>You have a goat, I'm hungry, I\u2019m stronger than you, I kill you and take your goat. </p> <p>Harsh, but true.</p> <p>Over time, people started forming tribes and communities, and they needed a way to exchange value. That\u2019s how barter was born: trading one good for another.</p> <p>But barter had big limitations:  </p> <p>What if I need three eggs but only have one cow? Maybe a cow is worth 300 eggs\u2026 do I cut it into pieces? Then I\u2019d basically lose the whole cow.</p> <p>Barter quickly became a logistical nightmare because of divisibility, fungibility, and the challenge of converting one good into another, without a proper monetary system. On top of that, many goods weren\u2019t durable: they spoiled fast, being organic or perishable, and were often hard to transport for long distances.  </p> <p>Pay close attention to the bold words above: they\u2019re clues pointing to important properties of money.  </p> <p>Noticing the limitations of barter, people began designating specific goods (with certain objective properties) as money. For example, durable, easily transportable, and divisible goods like salt and honey started being used. Some cultures even used shells or stones as money.  </p> <p>The next step was metals: they were strong, durable, and scarce. Over time, a kind of global distributed \u2018game theory\u2019 naturally led to gold becoming the preferred form of money. Its unique properties made it the \u2018king\u2019 of money for over 5,000 years, in almost every region of the world.  </p> <p>At this point, it should be clear that money\u2019s properties can\u2019t be entirely subjective, as some modern economic theories suggest.  There are objective properties that really matter and some of these key properties include:  </p> <ul> <li>Scarcity: how limited and available a good is.  </li> <li>Fungibility: how interchangeable each unit is with any other.</li> <li>Durability: how well it lasts and keeps value over time.</li> <li>Portability: how easily it can move through space and time.</li> <li>Recognizability: how easy it is to verify (and how hard to counterfeit).</li> <li>Divisibility: how easily it can be split into smaller units.</li> </ul> <p>By the time you finish reading this site, hopefully youl will understand that Bitcoin surpasses gold (the king of money) in almost every one of these properties.  </p> <p>We can better understand these properties through a practical example:  </p> <p>Let us imagine a country where people are absolutely obsessed with bananas. The reason is unclear. Perhaps genetic modifications, perhaps something else...but the fact remains: the population loves bananas. This can be classified as a subjective preference. Neighboring countries do not share this enthusiasm, yet the locals value bananas so highly that they decide to adopt them as a form of money. However, this collective agreement does not alter the physical characteristics of bananas, which make them poorly suited for this role. In other words, bananas fail to meet the objective properties previously outlined. For instance, bananas are well known for their tendency to spoil within days or weeks. This makes them inherently prone to hyperinflation, understood here as the rapid degradation of the monetary medium itself, one that clearly fails to preserve value over time.  </p> <p> Continue to the next chapter to learn more about inflation!</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/","title":"Bitcoin","text":""},{"location":"bitcoin/#the-invention-of-digital-scarcity","title":"The invention of digital scarcity","text":"<p>Bitcoin is best understood not as a company, a product, or a financial instrument, but as a breakthrough in how humans coordinate around value without relying on trust in any single authority. </p> <p>For the first time in history, digital information can be made scarce, verifiable, and resistant to control, while still remaining open to anyone who wishes to use it.</p> <p>This may sound abstract at first, but its implications are profound.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#what-bitcoin-actually-is","title":"What Bitcoin actually is","text":"<p>At its core, Bitcoin is a global network of computers that all agree on one shared history.

It changes the rules of who controls value, who can store wealth safely, and how people interact with money. And whenever the rules of money change, those who were in control start to feel nervous.  </p> <p>Most modern governments rely on control of money to function: they can print more, manipulate interest rates, and manage debt to influence the economy. This control gives them power over society and allows them to spend, borrow, and tax in ways that maintain their authority and fund their priorities.  </p> <p>Bitcoin removes much of that control.  </p> <p>No government can print more Bitcoin to fund its programs or wars. No central bank can artificially lower its value to stimulate spending.   Transactions cannot be reversed, frozen, or censored by politicians. The traditional levers of monetary power no longer work in the same way.  </p> <p>This is why governments often react with suspicion, regulation, or even outright hostility. They see Bitcoin as a challenge to the existing system because it empowers individuals rather than institutions. People can preserve their wealth without relying on banks, national currencies, or state policies. That freedom is threatening to anyone whose influence depends on controlling money.  </p> <p>Bitcoin also exposes uncomfortable truths about the current system: inflation quietly transfers wealth from the many to the few, bailouts protect insiders, and financial crises often punish ordinary people more than the elite. Bitcoin, by being transparent, scarce, and neutral, makes these practices visible and avoidable.  It shines a light on inefficiencies and unfairness that governments and powerful institutions might prefer to keep hidden.</p> <p>At the same time, resistance to Bitcoin is often framed as concern for safety, taxation, or financial stability. Critics warn about volatility, criminal use, or environmental impact.  Some of these concerns are valid and deserve discussion, but they are amplified because Bitcoin challenges the established order.</p> <p>Ultimately, governments fear losing the ability to quietly control wealth and influence economic behavior. Bitcoin is permissionless and global, meaning that even if one country bans it, the network continues to function. Its power cannot be easily contained.  </p> <p>Whoever controls the money often controls much of society and by taking that power away from governments and returning it to individuals, Bitcoin changes not only the economy but the balance of power itself.  </p> <p>For this reason, understanding Bitcoin is also about understanding freedom, incentives, and trust.  </p>"},{"location":"scarcity/","title":"Scarcity","text":""},{"location":"scarcity/#why-good-money-must-be-hard-to-make","title":"Why good money must be hard to make","text":"<p>After understanding inflation, we can now identify the real problem with most forms of modern money:  </p> <p>They are easy to create.</p> <p>When money can be produced effortlessly and by a selected group of few, it cannot reliably preserve value over time, no matter how strong the promises behind it may sound.  </p> <p>To understand why scarcity matters so much, we need to take a closer look at what gives money its strength in the first place.</p> <p>Scarcity is one of the most important objective properties of money, because it defines how difficult it is to create new units of it.</p> <p>If something is abundant or can be produced at will, it cannot function well as money, even if people temporarily agree to use it.</p> <p>We see this pattern everywhere:  </p> <p>Air is essential for life, yet it has no monetary value because it is abundant.

But how does it actually function? How can computers, without a boss or a central bank, all agree on who owns what? The answer lies in a combination of clever rules, math, and incentives.  </p> <p>At the heart of Bitcoin is the blockchain. Think of it as a global, shared notebook that records every transaction ever made:  I have a copy of it, your uncle has a copy on it, some guy in India has a copy of it, everyone running Bitcoin software store a copy of it.   Every entry in this notebook is public and can be checked by anyone, anywhere. Once something is written down, it cannot be erased or changed. This is why Bitcoin is verifiable and trustworthy without relying on any single institution.</p> <p>New transactions are grouped together into blocks. Each block contains a list of transfers and a special code that links it to the previous block, forming a chain. This is why it is called a blockchain. Because each block depends on the one before, it becomes nearly impossible to change history without redoing all the work that came after it.</p> <p>But who decides what gets written into the blockchain? That job is done by miners.  Miners are participants who compete to solve extremely difficult math problems. These problems are not puzzles for fun: they require real-world energy and computing power, which makes cheating expensive. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the next block to the chain and is rewarded with newly created Bitcoin. This is called mining, and it is how new Bitcoin enters the system.</p> <p>Mining serves two critical purposes at once. It creates scarcity because new Bitcoin is produced slowly and predictably, and it secures the network because any attempt to alter history would require redoing all the math (using energy) faster than the entire network combined, which is practically impossible.  </p> <p>You have probably heard people say that mining is terrible for the environment. As we have seen before, nothing is worse for the environment than a monetary system that is centrally controlled and disconnected from the underlying thermodynamic reality.  </p> <p>Bitcoin mining uses energy to secure the network and to prevent arbitrary creation of money.  At the same time, mining has always encouraged the use of more efficient and cleaner energy sources, while reducing energy waste because surplus energy can be captured and put to productive use. Saying that mining is a waste of energy is like saying that a heating system in a place where people live and where it is minus thirty degrees Celsius is a waste of energy.  </p> <p>The process of agreeing on the next block is called consensus. Bitcoin uses a method called proof of work. Everyone in the network can see which block is valid because the rules are clear: the first block to meet the mathematical requirements wins, and everyone else automatically accepts it. There is no vote, no committee, and no human discretion. This makes Bitcoin extremely resistant to corruption and manipulation.</p> <p>Security in Bitcoin comes from two things: math and incentives. Cryptography ensures that only the rightful owner of Bitcoin can spend it, and the network design makes it unprofitable for anyone to cheat. Breaking the system would cost more in resources than anyone could ever gain, which is why people trust it.</p> <p>Another important concept is finality. Once a transaction is included in a block and several blocks are built on top of it, it becomes effectively permanent. You can think of it as ink that hardens with every new layer added. This is different from the banking system, where transactions can be reversed or frozen. Bitcoin gives you ownership that is final and independent of any authority.</p> <p>Finally, Bitcoin is borderless and permissionless. Anyone can join, anyone can verify, anyone can send or receive money without asking for approval. There is no gatekeeper and no central control. This makes it the first form of money in history that is truly open and global, yet still secure and scarce.</p> <p>At a high level, Bitcoin works because it combines three elements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Scarcity enforced by code and mining effort.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security ensured by cryptography and economic incentives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decentralized consensus that allows thousands of independent participants to agree on a single history without trusting anyone.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Put together, these create a new form of money that is digital, global, verifiable, and hard to corrupt. It is a system designed to function reliably for decades or even centuries, without relying on any single government, company, or individual to uphold it.</p> <p>Understanding this gives you a glimpse of why Bitcoin is so revolutionary. It is not just money but a completely new way of coordinating human value across space and time.  </p> <p>The next chapter will explore why this changes everything about wealth, savings, and power, and why Bitcoin can be called a monetary reset for the modern world.  </p>"},{"location":"what-bitcoin-is-not/","title":"What Bitcoin is not","text":""},{"location":"what-bitcoin-is-not/#all-the-stories-youve-heard","title":"All the stories you\u2019ve heard","text":"<p>Let\u2019s begin with the assumption that everything you\u2019ve heard from friends, family, the media, or anywhere else about Bitcoin so far is either wrong or incomplete, and let\u2019s go back to the fundamentals.</p> <p>First, let\u2019s clarify what Bitcoin definitely is not:  </p> <ul> <li>It\u2019s not a get-rich-quick scheme.

Savings can evaporate quietly while the system continues to function.</p> <p>Bitcoin changes this. Because its rules are fixed and enforced by software, nobody can arbitrarily create more Bitcoin, reverse your transactions, or seize your coins. It is the first form of money in history that is truly independent of any authority. This gives individuals unprecedented control over their wealth.</p> <p>Bitcoin also shifts the incentives of society. In a world dominated by inflationary money, there is pressure to spend quickly, take on debt, and chase short-term gains. Holding money for the long term is punished because its value erodes over time. With Bitcoin, holding and planning long term is rewarded. Its predictable supply encourages saving, patience, and strategic thinking.</p> <p>In practical terms, this can have enormous effects:</p> <p>Imagine a world where people can store wealth without fear of hidden inflation. Entrepreneurs can plan multi-year projects without worrying that sudden money printing will make their savings worthless.  Ordinary people can protect their life\u2019s work from political or economic instability. Humans begin to look toward the future and think about the world they will leave for their children and grandchildren.    </p> <p>It also redefines global finance. Unlike national currencies, Bitcoin is borderless. You can send it anywhere in the world instantly, without needing banks or clearinghouses.  You can integrate it into applications, technology infrastructure, and open source projects. It removes barriers to trade, remittances, and access to financial services, especially in countries with weak or unstable currencies. For the first time, a single form of money can truly operate at a global scale without a central controlling entity.</p> <p>Finally, Bitcoin introduces a new form of fairness. Traditional monetary systems concentrate power in the hands of governments, banks, and large institutions. Inflation quietly transfers wealth from ordinary people to those closest to the creation of new money. Bitcoin eliminates this hidden tax because its supply is fixed and transparent. Everyone plays by the same rules, and no special privileges exist.</p> <p>In short, Bitcoin is a monetary reset because it takes the flaws of the old system (arbitrary inflation, concentration of power, and fragility of trust) and replaces them with a system that is predictable, permissionless, and incorruptible.  </p> <p>This is why many people call it sound money for the digital age. The next chapter will explore why some people resist Bitcoin, why governments feel threatened by it, and what this tells us about the hidden forces shaping money and power in the world today.</p>"}]}
