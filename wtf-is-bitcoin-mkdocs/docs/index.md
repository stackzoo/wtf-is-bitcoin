# Introduction


## Who this site is for
I’ve been diving into Bitcoin for almost 10 years now, and the more I learn, the more I’m convinced it’s an essential tool for humanity moving forward.  
Yet, even though Bitcoin has been around for quite a while (since January 3, 2009!), most people I talk to still don’t really know what it is, this site is for all of them.  
This site is for my parents, who grew up trusting banks and institutions, and are now trying to make sense of a world that feels very different from the one they were promised.  

This site is for my colleagues, who are curious but busy, and who want clear explanations instead of hype or jargon.  


This site is for my friends, who have heard conflicting stories, strong opinions, and scary headlines, and would like to understand Bitcoin without feeling talked down to.  

This site is for people who are locked into paying a mortgage for life, constantly trading their time and energy just to keep a roof over their heads, and who deserve a monetary system that does not work against them. 


This site is for the construction worker, who trades physical effort and skill for money, and deserves a form of savings that cannot be quietly weakened over time.  

This site is for the high school student, who will inherit the world as it is being reshaped today, and who should have the tools to understand the systems they are being born into.  


This site is for those who care deeply about freedom and personal sovereignty.  

This site is for the curious, the skeptical, and the undecided.

This site is for anyone who still does not know what Bitcoin is, but feels that understanding money might be more important than they were ever taught.
 

The approach here is simple: to educate, clearly and practically, without overcomplicating things.  

## Who this site is not for 
This site is not for people looking for get-rich-quick schemes, day-trading hacks, or investment advice.  
It’s also not for people who want a technical deep dive into Bitcoin’s inner workings, there are already many resources for that like [learn me a bitcoin](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/) (which also have a very informative [beginners section](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/)).  

**NOTE**:   
**In order to explain concepts from diverse fields (such as computer science, economics, philosophy, mathematics, and history) in the clearest way possible, this site inevitably makes trade-offs, simplifying the complexity of some topics to make them accessible to a broader audience.**
