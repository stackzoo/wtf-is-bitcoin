This site is for my parents, who grew up trusting banks and institutions, and are now trying to make sense of a world that feels very different from the one they were promised.  </p> <p>This site is for my colleagues, who are curious but busy, and who want clear explanations instead of hype or jargon.  </p> <p>This site is for my friends, who have heard conflicting stories, strong opinions, and scary headlines, and would like to understand Bitcoin without feeling talked down to.  </p> <p>This site is for people who are locked into paying a mortgage for life, constantly trading their time and energy just to keep a roof over their heads, and who deserve a monetary system that does not work against them. </p> <p>This site is for the construction worker, who trades physical effort and skill for money, and deserves a form of savings that cannot be quietly weakened over time.  </p> <p>This site is for the high school student, who will inherit the world as it is being reshaped today, and who should have the tools to understand the systems they are being born into.  </p> <p>This site is for those who care deeply about freedom and personal sovereignty.  </p> <p>This site is for the curious, the skeptical, and the undecided.</p> <p>This site is for anyone who still does not know what Bitcoin is, but feels that understanding money might be more important than they were ever taught.</p> <p>The approach here is simple: to educate, clearly and practically, without overcomplicating things.  </p>"},{"location":"#who-this-site-is-not-for","title":"Who this site is not for","text":"<p>This site is not for people looking for get-rich-quick schemes, day-trading hacks, or investment advice.

Long ago, money didn\u2019t exist, and it was basically the law of the jungle:  </p> <p>You have a goat, I'm hungry, I\u2019m stronger than you, I kill you and take your goat. </p> <p>Harsh, but true.</p> <p>Over time, people started forming tribes and communities, and they needed a way to exchange value. That\u2019s how barter was born: trading one good for another.</p> <p>But barter had big limitations:  </p> <p>What if I need three eggs but only have one cow? Maybe a cow is worth 300 eggs\u2026 do I cut it into pieces? Then I\u2019d basically lose the whole cow.</p> <p>Barter quickly became a logistical nightmare because of divisibility, fungibility, and the challenge of converting one good into another, without a proper monetary system. On top of that, many goods weren\u2019t durable: they spoiled fast, being organic or perishable, and were often hard to transport for long distances.  </p> <p>Pay close attention to the bold words above: they\u2019re clues pointing to important properties of money.  </p> <p>Noticing the limitations of barter, people began designating specific goods (with certain objective properties) as money. For example, durable, easily transportable, and divisible goods like salt and honey started being used. Some cultures even used shells or stones as money.  </p> <p>The next step was metals: they were strong, durable, and scarce. Over time, a kind of global distributed \u2018game theory\u2019 naturally led to gold becoming the preferred form of money. Its unique properties made it the \u2018king\u2019 of money for over 5,000 years, in almost every region of the world.  </p> <p>At this point, it should be clear that money\u2019s properties can\u2019t be entirely subjective, as some modern economic theories suggest.  There are objective properties that really matter and some of these key properties include:  </p> <ul> <li>Scarcity: how limited and available a good is.  </li> <li>Fungibility: how interchangeable each unit is with any other.</li> <li>Durability: how well it lasts and keeps value over time.</li> <li>Portability: how easily it can move through space and time.</li> <li>Recognizability: how easy it is to verify (and how hard to counterfeit).</li> <li>Divisibility: how easily it can be split into smaller units.</li> </ul> <p>By the time you finish reading this site, hopefully youl will understand that Bitcoin surpasses gold (the king of money) in almost every one of these properties.  </p> <p>We can better understand these properties through a practical example:  </p> <p>Let us imagine a country where people are absolutely obsessed with bananas. The reason is unclear. Perhaps genetic modifications, perhaps something else...but the fact remains: the population loves bananas. This can be classified as a subjective preference. Neighboring countries do not share this enthusiasm, yet the locals value bananas so highly that they decide to adopt them as a form of money. However, this collective agreement does not alter the physical characteristics of bananas, which make them poorly suited for this role. In other words, bananas fail to meet the objective properties previously outlined. For instance, bananas are well known for their tendency to spoil within days or weeks. This makes them inherently prone to hyperinflation, understood here as the rapid degradation of the monetary medium itself, one that clearly fails to preserve value over time.  </p> <p> Continue to the next chapter to learn more about inflation!</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/","title":"Bitcoin","text":""},{"location":"bitcoin/#the-invention-of-digital-scarcity","title":"The invention of digital scarcity","text":"<p>Bitcoin is best understood not as a company, a product, or a financial instrument, but as a breakthrough in how humans coordinate around value without relying on trust in any single authority. </p> <p>For the first time in history, digital information can be made scarce, verifiable, and resistant to control, while still remaining open to anyone who wishes to use it.</p> <p>This may sound abstract at first, but its implications are profound.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#what-bitcoin-actually-is","title":"What Bitcoin actually is","text":"<p>At its core, Bitcoin is a global network of computers that all agree on one shared history.

Money then lets you transfer this value across space: for example, sending it to someone far away  and time:  for example, saving it or passing it down to your grandchildren. Since the time and skills you put into providing a valuable, in-demand service come from you, only you should own the money you earn, and it should be entirely your choice when and how to spend it.  </p> <p></p> <p>Keep reading for a brief history of money!</p>"}]}
